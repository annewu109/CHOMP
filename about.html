                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to <strong>CHOMP</strong> — your partner in making healthy eating simple, efficient, and
                        stress-free.</p>

                    <p>At CHOMP (Consumer Health Oriented Meal Prepping), we believe that eating well shouldn't be a
                        chore.
                        That's why we’ve created a platform that streamlines meal prepping and grocery shopping into a
                        single,
                        easy process. With CHOMP, you can browse a variety of balanced, delicious meal options, add them
                        to your
                        plan, and instantly populate your grocery cart with exactly what you need. Then, with just a few
                        clicks,
                        your ingredients are delivered straight from the nearest grocery store to your doorstep — fresh,
                        fast,
                        and hassle-free.</p>

                    <h3>Our mission is simple:</h3>
                    <p>Take the stress out of cooking for yourself while supporting a healthier, more mindful lifestyle.
                    </p>

                    <p>We designed CHOMP to tackle some of the biggest everyday challenges:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meal fatigue</strong> — by offering a rotating selection of meals so you're never
                            stuck
                            eating the same thing over and over.</li>
                        <li><strong>Food waste</strong> — by giving you exactly the right ingredients for the meals you
                            choose,
                            no random leftovers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expensive, unhealthy eating habits</strong> — by making it easier to cook at home
                            instead of
                            relying on costly takeout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Portion control</strong> — with recipes designed to meet your specific needs,
                            whether you're
                            prepping for one or a family.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision fatigue</strong> — by handling the "what's for dinner?" question so you can
                            spend
                            your time on what matters most.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>At CHOMP, we’re not just about meal prepping — we’re about empowering you to eat better, feel
                        better, and
                        live better.<br>
                        Less waste. Less stress. More delicious, healthy meals — made easy.</p>
